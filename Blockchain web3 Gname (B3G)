Gname- A unique, blockchain-based identifier that represents a user's digital identity - Gname can be used to manage digital assets, interact with Web3 applications, and establish a persistent online presence.
"Blockchain Web3 Gname" (B3G) represents the intersection of blockchain technology, the Web3 ecosystem, and decentralized identity management.
1. "_Decentralized Identity_: (B3G) enables users to manage their digital identity and interact with Web3 applications.
2. _Blockchain Foundation_: The use of blockchain technology ensures security, transparency, and decentralization.
3. _Web3 Interoperability_: (B3G) can be used across various Web3 applications and platforms, enabling seamless interactions.
